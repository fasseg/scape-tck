Connector API Technical Compability Kit
=======================================

This TCK mocks a SCAPE Connector API and exposes the various end point via HTTP. 

In order to run this mock the following dependencies have to be available to maven:

 - https://github.com/fasseg/scape-dto
 - https://github.com/fasseg/mets-dto

In order to start a Mockservice, create an instance of ConnectorAPIMock, wrap it in a thread like so:

    private final ConnectorAPIMock mock = new ConnectorAPIMock(8387);

    public void setup() throws Exception {
        Thread t = new Thread(mock);
        t.start();
        while (!mock.isRunning()) {
            Thread.sleep(10);
        }
        // Mock is now running and exposes it's end points on port 8387
        // e.g. HTTP1.1/GET http://localhost:8387/entity/<entity-id>
        [..GET/PUT/POST/DELETE..]
    }



For an example of the Mock in action please check the tests in the following class:
